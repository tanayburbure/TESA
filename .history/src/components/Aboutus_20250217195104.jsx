        Established in 2012 under the Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering (ENTC) Department at AISSMS IOIT, TESA was founded under the guidance of the Principal, HOD, Chairperson(s), and faculty members. The association aims to foster maximum student participation, encouraging overall development by providing a platform to showcase talents and explore hidden potentials across various domains, including technical, cultural, and sports.
